                <p>
                    An engine is the heart of a vehicle, converting fuel into motion. It's a mechanical marvel that powers cars, generating the force needed for movement. Engines come in various types, such as gasoline, diesel, hybrid, and electric, each with its unique advantages. They're designed to provide efficiency, performance, and reliability, catering to different needs and preferences of drivers worldwide.

                <h3>Why choose a gasoline engine</h3>
                <p>A gasoline engine provides ease of use and widespread availability of fuel. It offers strong performance and is generally more cost-effective in terms of initial purchase compared to other options.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="job job-2">
                <h3>Why choose a hybrid</h3>
                <p>A hybrid car combines a gasoline or diesel engine with an electric motor, providing better fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. Additionally, it allows for short electric-only trips, which is environmentally beneficial and saves on fuel costs.</p>

            <div class="job job-3">
                <h3>Why choose a full electric</h3>
                <p>A full electric car produces zero emissions and offers a quiet and smooth driving experience. Moreover, its operating costs are usually lower than those of internal combustion engine cars since electricity is often cheaper than fuel. Additionally, full electric cars are generally easier to maintain due to having fewer moving parts, reducing the need for maintenance.</p>
