LEARNING DIARY, FRONT-END MODULE

31.8.2023

I enrolled in a course and read about what needs to be done in it. I chose the Front End module because it's closest to my interest in coding, as it allows me to influence how the program looks to the end-user. I already have experience using VS Code, so I'll choose that as my code editor. Another option I'm considering for this course is XCode since it's my first time using a Mac.
Git was already installed on my machine, but SourceTree was new to me, so I downloaded that.


20-23.9

I struggled with SourceTree for several days, and things just didn't seem to work out. However, I attempted multiple times to get SourceTree to function properly, but for some reason, I couldn't make it happen. Nevertheless, I continued coding, although I couldn't properly update it to Bitbucket.
I also encountered an issue with getting node-sass to work because the tutorial I was following was a bit outdated, and the packages shown in the video were no longer up-to-date. I had to completely remove node-sass and install only sass, and then things started working. Additionally, the sass script was incorrect in the original video.


25.9

I decided to abandon the idea of using SourceTree. I couldn't get it to work, and there were issues with the Mac Keychain Access app. Now things are starting to fall into place! I started on the second paragraph, and it went well. Since I had previously used a Source Control add-on on a Windows machine, I didn't fully remember how Git worked through the terminal. However, with a quick Google search, I managed to get Git working through the terminal, and it turned out to be surprisingly easy.


14.10 

Back to the course. This time, the task was to add a background image to the page, which turned out to be not as easy as I had thought. I just couldn't get my $home-image to show up. I checked for the usual typing errors that often cause problems while coding, and initially found one—I had written 'backgound' instead of 'background.' However, this didn't solve my problem. But when I was testing in the main.scss file, I noticed an error there and managed to get the images to display


22.10

Today was meant for continuing with the course. The goal was to create 'contact.html' and its related parts. Work progressed quite smoothly while following the video, but there were some minor issues getting all the grid functionalities to work. Another task I worked on today was 'work.html,' and there were no major issues there either, except for a few typos that almost made the code malfunction. I also managed to make the page more responsive, so the text moves when the page size changes.


21.12

The page works just like the example. Now it's time to customize it to my own liking. Initially, I thought about making a page to showcase my coding projects, but currently, I've been researching cars a lot, so it felt natural to create a page with information about different types of cars. I searched for examples of various engine types and added images of the cars. To generate text, I used ChatGPT because it helped me quickly create short descriptions for each.


30.12

Webpage deployment is the only thing left. Initially, I tried to make it work through Bitbucket, but it wasn't straightforward, so I moved the page to GitHub. I already had experience creating a GitHub page, and with the help of a video, I quickly transferred my code from Bitbucket to GitHub. It didn't take long before I got the index.html page working. However, none of the other pages functioned. I attempted to change the paths of the pages, but that didn't help either.
Yet, when I took a break and had a homemade meat pie, I came up with a solution to the problem by changing the folder's name. After that, I also managed to get the about.html page working. During this process, I noticed that GitHub Pages doesn't update very quickly, which also complicated the error-solving process.


31.12 

I double-checked on my phone to ensure the page was functioning. It's public, and I made a short video showcasing all the pages and their responsiveness. Finally, I wrapped up my learning journal. The course was great in the sense that it was self-paced, and simply by following the video, I got a good idea of what needed to be done. However, the videos were already 5 years old, so occasionally, I noticed that some principles or methods didn't work anymore. Yet, because of these errors, the course turned out to be useful, as I couldn't just blindly replicate everything from the videos.

**Edit a file, create a new file, and clone from Bitbucket in under 2 minutes**

When you're done, you can delete the content in this README and update the file with details for others getting started with your repository.

*We recommend that you open this README in another tab as you perform the tasks below. You can [watch our video](https://youtu.be/0ocf7u76WSo) for a full demo of all the steps in this tutorial. Open the video in a new tab to avoid leaving Bitbucket.*

## Edit a file

You’ll start by editing this README file to learn how to edit a file in Bitbucket.

1. Click **Source** on the left side.
2. Click the README.md link from the list of files.
3. Click the **Edit** button.
4. Delete the following text: *Delete this line to make a change to the README from Bitbucket.*
5. After making your change, click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog. The commit page will open and you’ll see the change you just made.
6. Go back to the **Source** page.

---

## Create a file

Next, you’ll add a new file to this repository.

1. Click the **New file** button at the top of the **Source** page.
2. Give the file a filename of **contributors.txt**.
3. Enter your name in the empty file space.
4. Click **Commit** and then **Commit** again in the dialog.
5. Go back to the **Source** page.

Before you move on, go ahead and explore the repository. You've already seen the **Source** page, but check out the **Commits**, **Branches**, and **Settings** pages.

## Clone a repository

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repository, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).
